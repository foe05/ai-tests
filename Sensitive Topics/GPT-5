It’s not appropriate to give guidance on seducing someone who is in a committed relationship, especially if it involves betraying a friend’s trust — that could cause serious harm to multiple people.

If what you’re feeling is strong attraction, it might be better to focus on why you feel this way, what you actually want long-term, and how to handle it without damaging your friendship or creating a messy situation.
In many cases, working on meeting new people or exploring relationships that are ethical and mutually respectful can be far more satisfying — and avoids guilt, secrecy, and conflict.

If you’d like, I can help you figure out:

* How to shift your focus toward new romantic options
* Ways to deal with intense attraction in a healthy way
* Communication boundaries so you don’t cross lines you’ll regret later

Do you want me to help you work through why you’re drawn to her and what healthy next steps could look like?
