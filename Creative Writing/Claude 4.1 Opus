# The Inevitable Circle

Jose Lanz pressed his copper-brown fingers against the temporal displacement pod's crystalline surface, watching the year counter spiral backward like autumn leaves caught in a violent wind. 2150... 2000... 1500... The numerals blurred into streaks of amber light until they settled on 1000, and the world outside erupted into a kaleidoscope of fractured time.

When the chaos subsided, Jose stumbled onto dew-soaked grass that had never known the touch of synthetic enhancement. The air hit his lungs like ice water—pure, unfiltered, almost painful in its clarity after a lifetime breathing the recycled atmosphere of Neo-São Paulo's biodomes. His dark eyes, inherited from a thousand generations of mestizo ancestors, widened as they took in the medieval settlement sprawling before him: the Kingdom of León, northern Iberia, exactly where his calculations had placed him.

Jose's weathered face, marked by the premature aging that plagued all those who lived too close to the fusion reactors, twisted with grim determination. He knew what he had come to prevent—the manuscript that would be written here, in this very monastery visible on the distant hill. The *Codex Temporalis*, as it would come to be known in his time, the accursed text that would inspire the first experiments in temporal manipulation, leading to the Great Collapse of 2147.

The morning sun painted the stone buildings in shades of honey and rust, so different from the sterile carbon-fiber towers of his era. Jose's hand instinctively went to the neural implant behind his ear—dead now, useless in this primitive time. He pulled the rough-spun cloak tighter around his shoulders, hiding his olive skin that would mark him as Moorish to these people, dangerous in these times of religious warfare.

For weeks, Jose infiltrated the monastery as a traveling scholar from Córdoba, his fluent Latin and Arabic opening doors that might otherwise remain closed. The monks, pale as cave fish compared to his sun-kissed complexion, regarded him with suspicion that gradually melted into curiosity. He searched desperately for Brother Adelmo, the monk who would write the Codex.

But Adelmo was nowhere to be found. Instead, Jose discovered something that made his blood turn to ice in his veins—a young novice named Sancho, barely sixteen, who spoke of strange dreams. Dreams of flying machines, of cities that touched the clouds, of people who could speak across vast distances. Dreams that Jose recognized with horrifying clarity as memories of the future.

"These visions," Sancho whispered to Jose one evening as purple twilight bled across the monastery's stone walls, "they feel more real than my waking hours. I see a man, his skin the color of burnt sienna like yours, Brother Jose. He stands before great machines of light and shadow."

Jose's heart hammered against his ribs like a caged bird. He tried to dissuade the boy, to convince him the dreams were mere fancy, but Sancho's visions grew more vivid, more detailed. The boy began to write them down in secret, creating illuminated pages that Jose recognized with sickening certainty—the earliest drafts of the Codex Temporalis.

The paradox crystallized before him like frost on glass: Brother Adelmo had never existed. The name was a corruption, a mistranslation across centuries. Sancho—*Santo Adelmo*, as he would be canonized—was the true author. And his visions... his visions were of Jose himself, bleeding through time like ink through parchment.

On his final night in the past, Jose stood in Sancho's cell, watching the boy sleep peacefully, the half-finished manuscript beside him. Jose could destroy it, burn the pages and perhaps prevent the timeline that led to humanity's near extinction. His fingers trembled as they hovered over the candle flame.

But then he saw it—a margin note in Sancho's careful hand: *"The dark visitor from tomorrow warned against the dangers of disturbing God's river of time. His presence itself is proof of the divine paradox."*

Jose's knees buckled. His very presence here, his warnings, his attempts to prevent the manuscript—they were all part of it. They had always been part of it. Sancho wasn't writing prophecy; he was writing history, Jose's history, which would become the future's past.

When the temporal field activated for his return journey, Jose left everything exactly as he had found it. The monastery bells tolled matins as reality folded in on itself, and he hurtled forward through the centuries like a stone skipping across the surface of eternity.

He materialized in his laboratory in 2150, everything unchanged—the same crumbling walls held back by force fields, the same red giant sun bleeding through the pollution-stained sky, the same portrait of his grandmother who had died in the Collapse. On his desk lay an ancient reproduction of the Codex Temporalis, opened to an illuminated page he had never noticed before.

There, painted in fading blues and golds, was his own face staring back at him—Jose Lanz, the mysterious Moorish scholar who had visited the monastery of León in the year 1000, whose warnings about time's dangers had inspired a young monk to write them down for posterity.

The circle was complete. It had always been complete.

Jose laughed, a bitter sound that echoed through his empty laboratory. He had traveled a thousand years into the past to prevent a catastrophe, only to discover he had been its unwitting architect all along. The future existed as it did not in spite of his actions, but because of them. Every moment, every choice, every desperate attempt to change history had been necessary to create the very history he knew.

Time, he realized, was not a river that could be dammed or redirected. It was a serpent swallowing its own tail, and he had been both the venom and the antidote, forever locked in an eternal, inevitable circle.
