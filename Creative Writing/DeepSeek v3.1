Jose Lanz did not step into the past so much as he was violently unmade by it. The Chronos-Translator, a sphere of humming, coherent light in 2150, was here, in 1000 AD, a screaming rip in the fabric of reality. He stumbled out onto ground that felt… different. The air was a physical thing, a thick broth of loam, decay, and an impossible abundance of green. It smelled like life, raw and unchecked, a shocking contrast to the sterilized, recycled atmosphere of his century.

He was a man out of place, in every sense. His phenotype, a blend of Andean resilience and Spanish colonial history, marked him as alien here. His skin, the color of rich tierra, was smoother, lacking the hard-earned weathering of the people he would soon meet. His tall, lean frame, optimized for the low-gravity transit hubs of his time, seemed awkward and fragile among the stout, powerful builds of the 11th century. His dark eyes, used to the soft glow of smart-glass and holograms, winced at the sharp, unfiltered brutality of the sun.

He had come with a purpose, a historian’s folly. His world, 2150, was a marvel of sustainable technology and global peace, but it was built on a historical lacuna, a missing piece. The “Great Divergence,” a seemingly minor tribal war in the Amazon basin circa 1000 AD, had inexplicably erased a cultural group and their unique knowledge of myco-remediation—a fungal-based soil purification they had supposedly pioneered. Jose’s mission was simple: prevent the war, save the knowledge, and bring back a purer, even more advanced version of his own timeline. He believed his future existed *in spite of* this lost past. He was wrong.

He found the tribe, the Puka Mayu, or “Red River” people, not by his scanners, which were dead and silent, but by the sound of their drums and the scent of smoke and manioc roasting. They saw him emerge from the jungle, a specter in his form-fitting environmental suit, now smeared with mud and vines. They did not attack. They saw the confusion in his eyes, the lack of weaponry, and they called him *Yanaq*, a spirit. They were a people on the brink, their faces etched with a fear he had only read about in archives. A rival tribe, the fierce *Huaka*, were massing. The war was days away.

Jose, the man from the future, acted. He showed them how to divert a small stream to create a defensive moat. He explained the principle of triangulated archery, a simple concept to him, a revolutionary tactic to them. He pointed out poisonous fungi they could use to tip their arrows, a perversion of the very knowledge he had come to save. He did not see the paradox; he only saw a problem to be solved.

On the day of the Huaka assault, the Puka Mayu were ready. The battle was a short, brutal affair of shrieks and thudding blows. The diverted stream caused the Huaka to bunch up at a choke point. The triangulated arrows fell upon them. The poison did its grim work. The Puka Mayu, against all odds, were victorious. They hailed Jose as a god, a savior.

That night, amidst the celebration, the shaman, an old woman with eyes that held the deep time of the river itself, approached him. She held a gourd filled with a thick, dark paste. “*Yanaq*,” she said, her voice a dry leaf rustle. “You gave us war. Now we give you life. Our secret. The *Kurpa* fungus. It eats the bad spirit in the earth.”

Jose’s heart soared. This was it. The very technology. He took it, his hands trembling. This was his triumph.

She continued, her gaze piercing the veil of centuries. “The Huaka… they were not coming to destroy us. They were coming to take this.” She pointed to the paste. “Their land was sick. Their children were dying. They came not for war, but for this cure. A cure they believed we would never share.” She looked at the Huaka bodies being carried away. “Now, they will never ask. And the sickness in their land will grow. It will spread. For generations. It will change the river. It will change the world.”

The truth struck Jose with the force of a temporal shockwave. He hadn’t saved the Puka Mayu from extinction; he had *caused* it. The “Great Divergence” wasn’t a war that erased knowledge. It was a failed plea for help, a misunderstanding that led to a massacre, *this* massacre, which then allowed a land-sickness to fester and spread for centuries, irrevocably altering the ecosystem and the course of human development. The myco-remediation knowledge of the Puka Mayu wasn't lost in the war; it was made irrelevant by the environmental damage the war itself initiated.

His entire timeline—the polluted soils of the 22nd century that required his people’s most advanced tech to cleanse, the global cooperation born from a shared historical trauma of ecological collapse, the very reason his time-travel project was funded—all of it existed *because* of what he had just done. The problem he had come to solve was a problem he himself had invented. The future was not a destination; it was an echo. And he was the sound that had made it.

The recall field began to pull at his molecules, the world dissolving into shimmering fractals. He held the gourd of Kurpa paste, the original, perfect solution, now a hideous relic of his own ignorance. He was not bringing back a salvation for his time. He was bringing back the very cause of its brokenness.

He reappeared in the sterile white chamber of 2150. The technicians cheered. He stood there, a man who had always belonged to the past, holding the seed of his own present. The paradox was complete, a perfect, closed loop of cause and effect. He had gone to change history, only to realize he was its permanent, necessary fixture. The future was fixed, not because it was destined, but because it had already happened. And Jose Lanz, the man from the future, had always been its author.
