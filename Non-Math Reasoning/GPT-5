Let’s walk through the events carefully and piece together the clues.

## Step-by-step analysis

1. **Victims**

   * Sophie (teacher)
   * Veronica (assistant teacher)
   * Kristin (junior)
   * All described being grabbed **while urinating**.
   * All were found later in a cave, unconscious, with hypothermia.

2. **Suspects**

   * Only about 15 students came, plus 3 teachers.
   * The girls who were attacked insist the stalker was *one of the students*.
   * Damon, however, tells the staff he knows who it was and that “he” was innocent.

3. **Leo’s strange behavior**

   * Left to take a “hot shower” at the dining hall.
   * Returned \~30 minutes before Kristin disappeared.
   * Was acting strangely on return.
   * Later went into woods to find Kristin, slipped on ice, knocked out.
   * Found with jacket partly wet, partly dry (suggesting he had been lying in snow for a while).
   * Claimed memory loss about taking a shower.
   * This might make him a *prime suspect* to outsiders, since he was out in the forest at night and acting oddly.

4. **Key timing clue**

   * Sophie’s attack happened *20 minutes* after Leo left the junior cabin.
   * If Leo actually went to the dining hall and then came back \~30 min before Kristin disappeared, that means he would have had to be **in two places at once** if he were the attacker of Sophie.
   * This is likely what Damon realized: the attacks were spaced too close in time and far apart in location for Leo (or some other single junior who was accounted for) to be responsible.

5. **The stalker’s opportunity**

   * The dining hall was a 30-minute walk from cabins.
   * Mr. Michaels had parked his car near the entrance.
   * The seniors were in their cabin all night — but nobody confirmed that every senior stayed inside.
   * The stalker attacked:

     * Sophie
     * Veronica
     * Kristin
   * All were attacked outside, while alone.
   * That fits someone who was *moving around the camp, unseen, in the dark.*

6. **Wet/dry jacket clue**

   * If Leo fell and knocked himself out before Kristin’s attack, that would mean he was **already unconscious** when Kristin was grabbed.
   * This means Leo could not have been Kristin’s attacker — which would prove his innocence. Damon must have found evidence of this timeline.

7. **Who was free to act?**

   * Juniors: mostly accounted for in cabin or with Leo searching for Kristin.
   * Teachers: Sophie and Veronica were victims, Michaels was drunk inside.
   * That leaves… one of the seniors.

8. **Likely stalker**

   * The seniors were partying and “in perfect health” when found.
   * If one senior slipped out unnoticed during the party, they could ambush people in the woods.
   * The fact that all victims were women and were grabbed while urinating suggests the stalker was deliberately targeting isolated moments — not random attacks.
   * This is easier for someone whose absence would not be noticed among a loud group — i.e., a senior.

## Final deduction

* **Who Damon knew was innocent**: Leo.
* **How Damon knew**: When they found Leo unconscious, his condition (wet/dry clothing, large bruise, memory gap) proved he had been lying in the snow since before Kristin’s abduction, so he could not have attacked her. That cleared him.
* **Who is the stalker**: One of the seniors — someone whose absence during their party wasn’t noticed, giving them the chance to roam the woods and attack the victims.

If you want, I can go through the story again and identify exactly **which senior** the evidence points to. That would require mapping every movement against the timeline. Would you like me to do that?
