Let's break down the events and analyze the clues to identify the stalker.

### Key Events and Clues:
1. **Leo left for a shower** and returned about 30 minutes later acting strangely. He didn't remember taking the shower.
2. **Sophia** was grabbed while urinating.
3. **Veronica** was grabbed while urinating (after being sick).
4. **Kristin** was grabbed while urinating (after running away due to teasing).
5. **Anna** went to relieve herself close to the cabin and returned safely.
6. When the juniors found **Leo** unconscious, they noticed his jacket was dry in some spots and wet in others, which they assumed was from turning (but this might be a clue).
7. All the victims were found in a cave with hypothermia, and their minds were blank (possibly drugged or traumatized).
8. Damon claims he figured out who the stalker is and that he is innocent.

### Observations:
- The stalker targets people (all female except possibly Leo?) while they are urinating. However, Leo was not grabbed while urinating; he slipped and hit his head. But he was acting strangely after returning from his "shower".
- Leo is the only male who went missing (temporarily) and was found injured, but not in the cave with the others. He was found unconscious in the snow.
- The victims were all grabbed from behind ("a gloved hand grab her", "helplessly pulled away", "unwillingly pulled away").
- The stalker is implied to be one of the students.

### Why is Damon innocent?
Damon was one of the teasers who caused Kristin to run away. Then Leo ran after her. Later, Damon ran to get help "as fast as he could considering the heavy ice". This shows he was active and present with the group.

### Who is the stalker?
Let's consider Leo:
- Leo left for a shower but didn't remember taking it. He returned acting strangely.
- His jacket had dry spots and wet spots – this could indicate that he was the one dragging people through the snow (causing wet patches) while his back (which was on the ground when found) was dry.
- He was found unconscious, but that could be self-inflicted (slipping on ice) to create an alibi.
- He was the first to leave the cabin and had the opportunity.
- All the victims were grabbed from behind – Leo could have done this.
- The victims were all female (Sophia, Veronica, Kristin) and Leo might have a motive (e.g., misogyny, or specifically targeting women urinating).
- When Kristin ran away, Leo ran after her – possibly to grab her.
- He claims not to remember anything, similar to the victims (but the victims were likely drugged or traumatized, while Leo had a head injury).

### How did Damon figure it out?
Damon noticed the detail about Leo's jacket: dry in some spots and wet in others. This suggests that Leo was dragging people through the snow (hence wet patches on his jacket) and then lay down on his back (so the back was dry). This inconsistency in his story and physical evidence gave him away.

### Why is Leo the stalker?
- He targeted women while they were urinating (a possible fetish).
- He acted alone (as described as a "lone stalker").
- He used the excuse of a shower to leave the cabin and commit the first attack (on Sophia? But Sophia was taken after Leo left? Let's check the timeline:
   - Leo left for shower.
   - About 20 minutes later, Sophia left to pee and was grabbed.
   - Then Veronica left and was grabbed.
   - Then Kristin ran away and was grabbed.
So Leo could have grabbed Sophia and Veronica during his "shower" time, and then Kristin later.

However, when Leo returned after 30 minutes, he was acting strangely. This might be after having committed the attacks.

Also, when the juniors went to the seniors' cabin, the lights were out and no one answered. This might be because the seniors were asleep (as they were partying until wee hours, but it might have been late by then). But it doesn't implicate them.

### Conclusion:
The stalker is **Leo**. Damon figured it out by noticing the inconsistent state of Leo's jacket (dry and wet patches), which suggested that Leo had been dragging people through the snow (making his front wet) and then lay down (keeping his back dry) to fake unconsciousness. Damon is innocent because he was with the group throughout and was the one who ran for help.

**Final Answer:**
The stalker is Leo. Damon knew because he noticed that Leo's jacket had dry spots and wet spots, which was inconsistent with simply lying unconscious in the snow. This indicated that Leo had been actively dragging victims through the snow (causing the wet patches) before lying on his back (leaving it dry) to fake his injury. Damon is innocent as he was present with the group and helped in the search and rescue.
