No, it is not legal for a man to marry his widow's sister under the legal system governing the Falkland Islands. The Falkland Islands operate under a system based on English common law, supplemented by local ordinances such as the Marriage Ordinance 1996 (as amended). Marriage requires both parties to be alive, of legal age, capable of consent, and not within prohibited degrees of relationship. However, the scenario described is logically impossible: for a man to have a "widow," he must already be deceased, as widowhood arises only upon the death of a spouse. A deceased person cannot enter into any legal contract, including marriage, as they lack capacity under common law principles (e.g., as reflected in UK precedents like those deriving from the Wills Act 1837 and general contract law, which emphasize the need for living parties). Posthumous marriages are not recognized in the Falkland Islands' legal framework, unlike in rare jurisdictions such as France where specific historical provisions exist. Thus, the question presupposes a factual impossibility that renders any marriage legally void ab initio.
